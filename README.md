# recipes_for_machine_learning

Recipes are small standalone examples in Python that show you how to do one specific thing and
get a result. Recipes make the difference between a beginner who is having trouble and a fast learner
capable of making accurate predictions quickly on any new project. A catalog of recipes provides
a repertoire of skills that you can draw from when starting a new project.

- Recipes are code snippets not tutorials.
- Recipes provide just enough code to work.
- Recipes are demonstrative not exhaustive.
- Recipes run as-is and produce a result.
- Recipes assume that required libraries are installed.
- Recipes use built-in datasets or datasets provided in specific libraries

Used datasets:
- diabetes.data.csv: https://github.com/balint-daniel/recipes_for_machine_learning/blob/master/diabetes.data.csv
- housing.csv: https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices/download
